        <p class = "abtme">I completed my schooling, and now i am pursuing my degree in a reputated institution in India. I like to code, game, eat well, and roam around frequently. I am into weight training for the past 3 months, and I have developed some good looking biceps, triceps and shoulders, with forearms that are capable of vein check. So, I will wrap it with that.</p>
